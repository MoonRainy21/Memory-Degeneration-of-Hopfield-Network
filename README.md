This Repository is supplemental information for [Memory Degeneration of Hopfield Network(2022)]().

## Abstract

Hopfield Network is a neural network based on Ising model, which saves each state of nodes. Memory degeneration occurs in human brain due to aging or Alzheimerâ€™s disease. The cause of memory degeneration is known as defection of connections between neurons or death of neurons.\
We defected Hopfield Network, presenting defection of connections as Edge-Defection and death of neurons as Node-Defection. The memory degeneration of Hopfield Network on defection is analyzed quantitatively. In both model, we could investigate Logistic Curve.\
